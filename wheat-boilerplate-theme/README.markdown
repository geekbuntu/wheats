Wheat Boilerplate Theme
-----------------------

This repo holds a starting theme crafted for the [wheat](https://github.com/creationix/wheat/) blog engine.

This theme tries to bring the rock-solid template [html5-boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) in the nifty [Wheat](http://github.com/creationix/wheat) blog engine.

* a basic template for the layout (layout.haml taking markup from html5-boilerplate)
* the same for stylesheets (style.css & handled.css). Both are directly coming from html5-boilerplate.
* JS with plugin.js/script.js.
* Modernizr 1.6 & jQuery 1.4.4 waiting for you.
